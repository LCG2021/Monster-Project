# Monster Project
In this project you will create a simple text-based adventure game. The game will create a player object using information from a file, build a dungeon of three rooms each containing a monster, and allow the player to challenge the monster one-by-one and explore for treasure. The game will display messages on the screen to tell user what happens. It also creates a log file that keeps a record of the game.
